# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I’m originally from China and pursued a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Hong Kong. Keen to explore more, I continued with the BME Master’s program at Duke University, where I'm now a graduate student. My current research in Truskey's lab focuses on developing models representing myobundles’ physiology. This work is part of a broader effort to advance our understanding of muscle tissue engineering and its applications.
